[Sep 25th - Oct 3rd]
Writing: Introduction, related work - outline and draft
Coding: Intensive coding at the front-end, the basic useful version of TreeEnsembleVis.
Experiment: Provide 4-5 useful model, random forest and lightGBM, accuracy > 85%; apply the rule extraction method on these models

[Oct 4th - Oct 10th].

Writing: Finish the outline and draft before visual design and evaluation.
Coding: Evaluate the system with different experts. Finally fixed the final design. Finish coding at web server and front-end framework. 
Experiment: Adjust paraments and algorithm for the rule extraction method for better performance. Finish the experiment on the rule extraction method.
Case: The draft version of case1.

[Oct 11th - Oct 18th].
Writing: Finish the writing on most part of visual design. Make and edit figures.
Coding: Adjust the visual design with the case studies. Writing the draft for the experment.
Experiment: Make comparison with other model reduction methods (if necessary). 
Case: The draft version of case2.

[Oct 19th - Oct 26th].
Case: Finish case1 and case2. The draft version of case3 (if necessary)
Writing: Finish the slide and draft on case1 and case2.
Finish the writing part on the experiment.
Make figures and so on.

[Oct 27th – Oct 30th]. Finish writing, refine figures.

[Oct 31th – Nov 1st]. Videos. Refine writing. refine figures.
